# Shopping List Interview Challenge

- The original challenge text has had the entities and fields renamed but everything else is verbatim.

## Requirements

"Use git to track and submit your work on this exercise. You will be evaluated on using git commits with discrete purpose and descriptive messages. If you are familiar with TypeScript it can be used instead of JavaScript.

Initialize your project with create-react-app and styled-components, you may use additional libraries as desired. After setting up the repository, build an interface with the following features:
A text input, a “create button”, a list of completed todos, and a list of crossed-off todos. In each list todos are sorted alphabetically.

Typing in the text input filters the lists of todos below based on substring match

Clicking the create button adds a completed list item with the text from the input and clears the input

Clicking a completed item moves it to the crossed off section. Clicking a crossed off item moves it to completed.

Create an interface for editing additional metadata for each item, add metadata: category, description, and a number value to represent the amount of "points" the todo is worth. All three are optional inputs.

Description and points should be displayed in the list with the todos

Completed todos should be grouped by category, while crossed off todos remain in one list.

Display a subtotal (sum of all points) in the completed list."
